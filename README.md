# Dropmark - Image to Color Palette
>From images to maps, videos to websites, Dropmark lets you save everything in a centralized and searchable place. (Dropmark's Website)



As a designer, I think a great addition to Dropmark's amazing features would be the ability to generate and save color palettes from images. I decided to build a concept prototype of how I envisioned this color palette feature could be incorporated.

[View Prototype](https://jfocampo.github.io/)  |  [Learn About Dropmark](https://www.dropmark.com/)


## How To Use
To generate a color palette, click the add button on the top right. Choose a file (jpg/png) and click the "Dropmark This" button. To delete a single post, click the delete button under the post's dropdown menu.

------------ | ------------- | -------------
| 1. Add file by clicking the add button | 2. Upload a JPG/PNG, give it a title (optional) and click the Dropmark This button | Delete by hovering over palette and clicking the delete button |

# Please Note
For the purpose of keeping this prototype simple the only buttons/links that have actions are the following:
* Add button (top right)
* Choose file (add file window)
* Dropmark This (add file window)
* Delete (post dropdown)


## Additional Features
Below are some additional features that were not included in the prototype but that I believe would be really helpful.

### Download Palette & Copy SVG to clipboard
Downloading the color palette as an image and/or being able to copy an SVG to the clipboard would be essential to quickly start using the selected color palette.

### User Color Pick
Another feature that may be helpful for the user is the ability to change the colors after a color palette is generated by color picking.
